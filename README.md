To execute the program , you need to have python version 3.x.x. I have used python 3.10.7 and would recommend to use the same.

To execute the python script you can use the following command from the repo folder:
python test.py

Also if you would llike to make use of variable you can uncomment the following lines :
 #paragraph = input("Enter the paragraph you would like for the exercise: ")
 #width = int(input("Enter the width of the page: "))

And make the changes to the function call as follows:
 print(justify(paragraph, width))

Some test cases are written but they are not working as expected and throwing Assertion Error.
